# UMLINCA (LinThurber)

The Lin Thurber et al (2010) CVM is a seismic velocity model of the California crust and uppermost mantle 
using a regional-scale double-difference tomography algorithm. 

The UW statewide model is a three-dimensional (3D) tomographic model of the P wave velocity (Vp) structure 
of northern California. It was obtained using a regional-scale double-difference tomography algorithm that 
incorporates a finite-difference travel time calculator and spatial smoothing constraints. Arrival times 
from earthquakes and travel times from controlled-source explosions, recorded at network and/or temporary
stations, were inverted for Vp on a 3D grid with horizontal node spacing of 10 to 20 km and vertical node 
spacing of 3 to 8.
